# Goalie üèíü•Ö

Goalie is a TUI program designed to help you achieve your goals. It is based on,
but unaffiliated with, the [Complice](https://complice.co/) webapp. For the most
part, it functions in the same way as Complice, but running locally in a
terminal environment with keyboard controls.

I built Goalie mainly for my own personal use, and it is still in a pre-release
state. There are certain surprising behaviours it exhibits because of
unimplemented functionality, and of course, it currently has no usage
documentation. If you are looking to make more consistent progress towards your
goals, for most people I would recommend making use of Complice instead.
